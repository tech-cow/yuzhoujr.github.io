Dear Misha,

After reviewing the Signoff automation requirements specifications and consulted with Adam, I would like to discuss three potential solutions to your requests.

First Solution (50% Automation, immediately available):

This solution is meant to solve the manual signoff request, response and update mechanism by replacing the email system with the Navigator portal. The system fulfilled the following requirements:

R1: Provide an option to Initiate Signoff for any Release Type
R2: A signoff instance should contain certain fields (Graph/Table embedment currently not available)
R3: Historical data can be retrieved from the Navigator system


Second Solution (100% Automation, estimated time of development: 6+ months)

The second solution is to build the system from scratch. To be able to achieve 100% automation and get rid of all of the manual lookup, an Admin/User system needs to be developed. And I would also learn all of the data associated to be able to write the correct logic for data preprocessing.


Third Solution (80-90% Automation, estimated time of development: within 10 weeks)

The main problem with Solution 1 is because of the lack of visual presentation in the portal, and also because it didnâ€™t automate the other 50% of the data-gathering process. To be able to find the middle ground between development time and meeting the requirement, Adam suggested another method:

Focusing on data preprocessing, figure out how to automatically select the needed data to displace on the portal, and work on a UI to displace these results.

Product Managers would be able to use the Navigator portal right away to reduce 50% of the labor work, simultaneously, Wei and I can focus on creating a better method in data preprocessing to reduce the labor work in manual data gathering.

Let me know how you think!
Best,
Yu
